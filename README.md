#Commands for me to remember
- As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. You can do this by running **git commit -am "your commit message"**. Note that you should replace "your commit message" with a brief summary of the changes you made to your code.
- You can push these new commits to GitHub by running **git push origin master**, and to Heroku by running **grunt --force && grunt buildcontrol:heroku**.
